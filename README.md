# How to Install the App

Make sure these requirements are set up: [node & npm](https://nodejs.org/en/), [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

1. `git clone https://github.com/leta415/email-provider-server.git`
2. `cd email-provider-server`
3. `npm install`
4. To kick off the local server, run `npm start`

# Languages and Frameworks

I chose to use Express (NodeJS framework) because it seemed like a preferred language as stated in the coding challenge, and with some familiarity with Node, I thought it would be a great exercise for me to refresh my knowledge there. More recently I have been developing in a Python/WSGI codebase, but didn't feel sure enough to be building a Python server from scratch, so abandoned the idea.
